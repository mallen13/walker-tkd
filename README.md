# Walker Taekwondo Academy Website
This website is a client project built for a non-profit martial arts school. The project started off as a static website containing a home page, information about the organization, it's contact information, an image gallery, and a collection of blog posts.

Technologies used were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Design of the website is all original and effectively uses the organization's branding and colors. A focus on accesible colors, fonts, animations, and layout can be ovserved on the project. All buttons and links are accessible via keyboard without a mouse.

# Development
Development started with a strong desire to meet the clients needs and make an amazing project the looked good and functioned well. Client expectations were discussed along with the gathering of image assets and page content. 

Next, a draft was made of the website and reveled to the client for feedback. The development was extremely focused, as deadlines were in place for release. Updates were made, then final approval was given to publish the website. Hosting options and domain names, along with pricing, were discussed before the website went live. 

Rollout went well and users immediately started navigating to the website to sign-up for an upcoming Taekwondo tournament. 

Client epectations were exceeded.

# Roadmap
Future additions to the project are planned down the road. The client would like for their students to be able to check-in to class via an online sign-in form along with being able to make tuition payments through the website. Additionally, the client would like for a fullstack web application with a database and admin dashboard that tracks students attendance, belt testings, and contact information. 

The online check-in form, online payments, and student tracker application are planned to be developed using a Node.js backend and PostgreSQL database for persistent storage.
